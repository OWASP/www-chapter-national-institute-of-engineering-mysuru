The OWASP NIE Student Chapter is excited to host its first meetup of the Fall Semester 2025. This kickoff session will introduce our semester theme "Secure by Design" and outline our exciting plans for the coming months. The meetup will feature a brief overview of our three project tracks: Web Application Vulnerability Assessment, Mobile Security Testing, and API Security Framework Development.\
Members will have the opportunity to join project teams, learn about upcoming workshops, and network with peers interested in cybersecurity. We'll also discuss our planned CTF competition and industry connect sessions that will provide valuable real-world exposure. This meetup aims to energize our community and set clear objectives for what promises to be our most engaging semester yet.
